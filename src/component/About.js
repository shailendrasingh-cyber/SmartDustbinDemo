                The Shivalik Smart Waste Management System is designed to help
                municipalities and organizations manage waste more efficiently. By
                monitoring the status of garbage bins in real-time, we can ensure
                timely waste collection and maintain a cleaner environment. Our
                mission is to leverage technology to create smarter and more
                sustainable cities. Our system monitors the fill levels of garbage bins in real-time
                and provides actionable insights for efficient waste management.
                Each bin's fill percentage is continuously updated and displayed on our website.
                When a bin reaches 75% capacity, an alert is triggered on the website,
                notifying the authorities to schedule a timely cleanup.
                This proactive approach ensures that bins are emptied before they overflow,
                keeping the environment cleaner and more hygienic.
